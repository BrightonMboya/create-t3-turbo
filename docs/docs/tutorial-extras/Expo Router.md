Create T3 Turbo uses expo router to make it to scale and maintain your application with file base routing. Every file in the `app` directory will be automatically become a route in your mobile navigation. You can visit the [Expo Router Docs](https://expo.github.io/router/docs) to learn more.

The entry point of expo router is the `apps/expo/index.tsx` file. Here, we configure our app and export the `ExpoRoot` from expo-router to allow fast refresh to update the context.
