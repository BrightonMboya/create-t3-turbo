Here are some commonly asked questions about Create T3 Turbo.

### Can you include Solito?

No. Solito will not be included in this repo. It is a great tool if you want to share code between your Next.js and Expo app. However, the main purpose of this repo is not the integration between Next.js and Expo - it's the codesplitting of your T3 App into a monorepo, the Expo app is just a bonus example of how you can utilize the monorepo with multiple apps but can just as well be any app such as Vite, Electron, etc.

Integrating Solito into this repo isn't hard, and there are a few [offical templates](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos) by the creators of Solito that you can use as a reference.

### What auth solution should I use instead of Next-Auth.js for Expo?

I've left this kind of open for you to decide. Some options are [Clerk](https://clerk.dev), [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs). Note that if you're dropping the Expo app for something more "browser-like", you can still use Next-Auth.js for those. [See an example in a Plasmo Chrome Extension here](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/chrome/apps/chrome).

The Clerk.dev team even made an [official template repository](https://github.com/clerkinc/t3-turbo-and-clerk) integrating Clerk.dev with this repo.

During Launch Week 7, Supabase [announced their fork](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-7-community-highlights#t3-turbo-x-supabase) of this repo integrating it with their newly announced auth improvements. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/supabase-community/create-t3-turbo).

### Does this pattern leak backend code to my client applications?

No, it does not. The `api` package should only be a production dependency in the Next.js application where it's served. The Expo app, and all other apps you may add in the future, should only add the `api` package as a dev dependency. This lets you have full typesafety in your client applications, while keeping your backend code safe.

If you need to share runtime code between the client and server, such as input validation schemas, you can create a separate `shared` package for this and import on both sides.
